Modified Emax Tinyhawk II Freestyle drone

This pre-assembled Toothpick drone was bought so I could learn to fly on an easy/cheap to repair frame that could fly almost anywhere thanks to its size. 

As such, it's been repaired and upgraded several times to keep it flying. It uses and analog VTX to allow for faster reactions and cheap repair.

Custom Off-the-Shelf components:
- ExpressLRS EP2 Rx
- Happymodel X12 5-in-1 Board (FC, ESC, VTX, RX)

# GP11M Mount

This mount hijacks the top plate mount of the tinyhawk's frame to mount a GoPro 11 Mini. It is awaiting testing post 3D printing out of PETG
