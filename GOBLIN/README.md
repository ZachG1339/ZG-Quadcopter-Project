Assembled myself with monster 2100kV rotorgeek motors and excess I/O to accomodate peripherals

This drone was designed to be far more powerful than GLaDOS with 2100 kV motors. It runs on an analog video system to provide lower latency so the pilot can react faster.

This drone will serve as the main platform for mechanical experimentation of custom parts.

This quadcopter runs the betaflight firmware for easy customization and customer support.
