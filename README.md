# ZG-Quadcopter-Project
**under construction** This repository contains parts lists and custom components made for FPV quadcopters I have assembled since 2023 as preparation for my Capstone project. The goal is to break in to the cinematography niche while also creating vehicles capable of testing pickup mechanisms.
