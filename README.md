# ZG-Quadcopter-Project
**under construction** 

This repository contains parts lists and custom components made for FPV quadcopters I have assembled since 2023 as preparation for my Capstone project. 

The goal is to break in to the cinematography niche while also creating vehicles capable of testing manipulation mechanisms. 

It also gives me an opportunity to work with my hands through soldering, carbon fiber-PCB interfaces, custom 3D printed mounts, and fastener + press fit based assembly
