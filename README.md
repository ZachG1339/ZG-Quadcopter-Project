# ZG-Quadcopter-Project
**under construction** 

This repository contains parts lists and custom components made for FPV quadcopters I have assembled since 2023 for my hobby as an amateur freestyle FPV pilot. 

The goal is to to have fun, but also to eventually break in to the cinematography niche while also creating vehicles capable of testing manipulation mechanisms. 

It also gives me an opportunity to work with my hands through soldering, carbon fiber-PCB interfaces, custom 3D printed mounts, and fastener + press fit based assembly
